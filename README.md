# Tech Future Hackathons

##Purpose

This repo organises a plan for the research projects I am working on.  Eventually I would love to form a group of fellow hackers to contribute research ideas and work on them together.  For now it is just me.  

Basically, the following items are pretty safe bets for technologies and paradigms that will continue to emerge and dominate in the next 5 - 10 years:

  - Mobile gaming (evolutions will be around the nature of game interactions.)
  - AI and ML (data collection in apps and ML models that evolve based on user behaviour.)
  - Augemented Reality (AR)/ Pure Virtual Reality(VR).
  	- Ray tracing for VR?  On-demand raytracing?
  - Progressive Web Applications vs Native Apps. 
  	- Not sure where the space is going to end up...  Both have pros and cons.
  - Golang for Server Containers and Desktop Applications
  	- Golang has real promise to evolve into a replacement for Java on Server systems.  I could also eventually be a compelling choice for writing native desktop apps.

##Repository Structure

The repository has two major folders:  "Projects" and "Experiments".  The Experiments folder contains sub folders that are roughly organized in the above tech future categories.  Each sub folder contains a README file and code.  The README file describes the experiment, how to build it and how (and if) the results are in any way integrated into one of the projects.

The Projects folder is intended to contain proof of concept projects that evolve as new experiments are completed.  I intend to keep the number of projects to a minimum and instead find creative ways to incorporate the experiments.  The projects are not intended to be directly commercial in nature (though that would be a nice side effect.)
