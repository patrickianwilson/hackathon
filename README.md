# hackathon
This repo is a track record and high level plan for the research projects I am working on.  Basically, the following items are pretty safe bets for technologies and paradigms that will continue to emerge and dominate in the next 5 - 10 years:

  - Mobile gaming (evolutions will be around the nature of game interactions.)
  - AI and ML (data collection in apps and ML models that evolve based on user behaviour.)
  - Augemented Reality (AR)/ Pure Virtual Reality(VR).
  		- Ray tracing for VR?  On-demand raytracing?
  - Progressive Web Applications vs Native Apps. 
  		- Not sure where the space is going to end up...  Both have pros and cons.
  - Golang for Server Containers and Desktop Applications
  		- Golang has real promise to evolve into a replacement for Java on Server systems.  I could also eventually be a compelling choice for writing native desktop apps.
